# Week One

This week was all about becoming more familiar with the data science workflow and understanding our projects. We also became acquainted with the history of DSPG and some of its past projects.

We started the first day doing an exercise where we had 90 minutes to analyze flight data from the Des Moines airport.

This exercise was a good warm-up into using ggplot2 again and remembering which figures and summary statistics to prioritize reporting.

We also listened to many interesting speakers, including Chris, Sadat and Cass Dorius at the research park.
