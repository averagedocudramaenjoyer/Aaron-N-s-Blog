The rate differs more or less uniformly around the state save for a few key regions.\nFinally, I looked at the reported mode of transport to work for each of the four counties. A similar stacked proportional bar graph was made to the ones for language and race above.\n\n# Compiled variable list for mode of transport\ntransportList = c(\"Automobile\" = \"B08006_002\",\"Bus\" = \"B08006_009\", \"Subway/Elevated Rail\" = \"B08006_010\", \"Train\" = \"B08006_011\",\"Light Rail\" = \"B08006_012\",\"Ferryboat\" = \"B08006_013\", \"Bicycle\" = \"B08006_014\",\"Walked\" = \"B08006_015\", \"Taxi/Motorcycle/Other\" = \"B08006_016\")\n\n# API Call\n\ntransport_counties &lt;- get_acs(geography = \"tract\",\n                       variables = transportList,\n                       state = \"IA\",\n                       year = 2021,\n                       survey = \"acs5\")\n\nGetting data from the 2017-2021 5-year ACS\n\n# Subset for relevant counties using str_detect()\ntransport_counties2 &lt;- transport_counties %&gt;%\n  filter(str_detect(NAME, \"Buchanan|Chickasaw|Grundy|Story\"))\n\n# Mutating 'county' column and labeling for each tract observation\ntransport_small &lt;- transport_counties2 %&gt;%\n  mutate(county = ifelse(str_detect(NAME, \"Buchanan\"), \"Buchanan County\",\n                    ifelse(str_detect(NAME, \"Chickasaw\"), \"Chickasaw County\",\n                      ifelse(str_detect(NAME, \"Grundy\"), \"Grundy County\", \"Story County\"))))\n\n\nplot_1 &lt;- transport_small %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(fill = variable, x = county, y = estimate)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", position = \"fill\") +\n  coord_flip() + \n  ggtitle(\"Mode of Transport to Work\")\n\nplot_2 &lt;- transport_small %&gt;%\n  filter(variable != \"Automobile\") %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(fill = variable, x = county, y = estimate)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", position = \"fill\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  ggtitle(\"Mode of Transport to Work (Other than Automobile)\")\n\nplot_1\n\n\n\n\nThis is a plot of the reported mode of transport to work for each of the 4 counties.

In two of the counties, “walking” is the majority response.\n\n\nI learned a lot by exploring this data, both about the census data itself and about different means of data wrangling in R. One of the biggest takeaways for me was being introduced to the “stringr” package and learning how to detect key words in strings. Along with that, I feel I have a clearer understanding of the “ifelse()” function and how it works. I also remembered how to add error bars to plots and how to make maps given the presence of the appropriate data. I’m looking forward to exploring these data sets even more and hope they will prove to be useful for our project."

Many of the functions that I have written so far are translations of excel formulas that our client shared with us, made with percentages taken from Bizminer business reports on the grocery industry. However, I’ve also been working on a function that takes latitude and longitude as input and outputs census geography data for that location (down to block level). So far, I have two: one that’s simple and one that is more complex.

    "text": "Grocery Project:\nThis week was centered on converting the sheets that our client gave us to useful functions for our project package. My functions were R translations of our clients sheet for estimating expenses of potential rural grocery stores.\nSo far, there are 8 functions that are derived from the expense estimation sheet, yet it is still a work in progress. Here are the ones we have so far:\nCost_of_Goods_Sold()\nGross_Margin()\nOfficer_Compensation()\nEmployee_Wages()\nOther_Operating_Expense()\nOperating_Income_Loss()\nAnnual_Rent()\nInterest_Expense()\nMany of these functions give different outputs based on the range that the input for total estimated revenue falls into. Here, the revenue ranges are listed in a table with the corresponding percentages for each variable (in decimal form):\n\nTherefore, some of our functions required a way to account for these differences. As it stands, this is dealt with through nested ifelse statements.\n\nEmployee_Wages &lt;- function(Total_Estimated_Revenue) {\n\n  ifelse(Total_Estimated_Revenue &lt; 500000, stop(\"error: no data for this revenue range\"),\n         percentage &lt;- ifelse(Total_Estimated_Revenue &lt; 999999.99, .0789,\n                              ifelse(Total_Estimated_Revenue &lt; 2499999.99, .0934,\n                                     ifelse(Total_Estimated_Revenue &lt; 4999999.99, .0751,\n                                            ifelse(Total_Estimated_Revenue &lt; 24999999.99, .0975, .1083)))))\n\n\n\n  Total_Estimated_Revenue * percentage\n}\n\nIt’s likely that more work needs to be done for error handling in functions like these.\nHere’s a function that depends on some other functions in the package:\n\nOperating_Income_Loss &lt;- function(Total_Estimated_Revenue) {\n  Goods_cost &lt;- Cost_of_Goods_Sold(Total_Estimated_Revenue)\n  Officer_comp &lt;- Officer_Compensation(Total_Estimated_Revenue)\n  Employee_Wages &lt;- Employee_Wages(Total_Estimated_Revenue)\n  Other_Expense &lt;- Other_Operating_Expense(Total_Estimated_Revenue)\n\n  Total_Estimated_Revenue - sum(Goods_cost, Officer_comp, Employee_Wages,\n                                Other_Expense)\n}\n\nMost of the functions only take one argument: Total Estimated Revenue. This will be calculated from the functions made from our revenue estimation sheet (Srika). Other functions, such as Annual_Rent() or Interest_Expense(), have inputs that are dependent upon a user’s individual scenario, such as the size of a loan or the rate of monthly rent for the building.\nThere are still questions left to be answered, such as how to precisely estimate the cost of depreciation and how to determine the correct use life of certain assets. However, our team all made significant progress this week.\n\n\nCoffee Talk\nI also learned a lot about text mining in R this week. I decided to compare the reviews from two gaming journalistic outlets for the past 5 Legend of Zelda games using certain text mining techniques. Some of the interesting libraries I learned about include:\n\ntm\ntidytext\nRWeka\nqdap\nplotrix\nrvest\nwordcloud\nsyuzhet\n\nHere are some plots from the project:\n\n\n\nWordcloud of the whole Zelda series\n\n\n\n\n\nPyramid Plot of IGN vs. Gamespot\n\n\n\n\n\nSentiments for Tears of the Kingdom\n\n\nMany of the techniques used for the project was from the Datacamp course “Text Mining with Bag of Words in R” and “Sentiment Analysis in R”.\nOverall, today has been a pretty good week."

The functions used in this project to calculate expenses for potential grocery stores do so by providing different percentages of revenue spent on expenses based off of how high the total estimated revenue input is at the beginning. The original excel sheet establishes 5 distinct ranges that each have different percentages of the revenue across the different line items of the sheet.\n\n\n\nPercentages for categories of expenses/income across revenue ranges/store sizes (Bizminer)\n\n\nThese ranges can be thought of as stand-ins for the different sizes of grocery stores. When a store takes in a certain amount of revenue, the function assigns a budget percentage corresponding to the assumed size of the store.\nAs it stands now, many of the functions make use of nested “ifelse” statements in order to find the budget percentage of an expense or a source of income and multiply it by the total estimated revenue. For example:\n\nEmployee_Wages &lt;- function(Total_Estimated_Revenue) {\n\n  ifelse(Total_Estimated_Revenue &lt; 500000, stop(\"error: no data for this revenue range\"),\n         percentage &lt;- ifelse(Total_Estimated_Revenue &lt; 999999.99, .0789,\n                              ifelse(Total_Estimated_Revenue &lt; 2499999.99, .0934,\n                                     ifelse(Total_Estimated_Revenue &lt; 4999999.99, .0751,\n                                            ifelse(Total_Estimated_Revenue &lt; 24999999.99, .0975, .1083)))))\n\n  Total_Estimated_Revenue * percentage\n}\n\nThe function gives the user an error message if they enter a revenue amount under $500,000 dollars due to there being no data at that range.\n\n\nThe Linearity Problem\nMany of the functions derived from the excel sheet “Estimating Expenses” have been written to take the total estimated revenue as an input and return the dollar amount of a certain cost in accordance to the average percentage of revenue spent on that cost for stores of a similar size. For example, a store that takes in $1,000,000 and a store that takes in $2,000,000 share common percentages for costs such as employee wages and officer compensation. This broad assignment of one percentage based on a large revenue window also applies to the function for calculating gross margin, or the amount of funds left over after accounting for the cost of goods for the store.\nHowever, since most of these functions receive the same input of total estimated revenue and all of the percentages for the expenses are bundled together for the same window of revenue, this creates a problem. Suppose we want to compare the profitability of a store that takes in $1,000,000 of revenue vs. $2,000,000. According to the way our calculations work now, both of these stores will have the same percentage of their revenue deducted as expenses. So if 95% of our revenue goes towards covering expenses for every value that falls within the window of $1,000,000 to $2,500,000, there is a perfect linear relationship between the revenue and the profit of the store; the $1,000,000 store collects $50,000 in profit while the $2,000,000 store collects $100,000. If we were to create a numeric regular sequence of revenue inputs from $1,000,000 to $2,500,000 and plot it against one of our measures of profit (before depreciation etc.), we would get:\n\n\n\nRevenue vs. Expense\n\n\nThis is a problem because the ultimate goal of our tool is to help potential grocery store owners decide which area could be more profitable for the store that they want to open than the next area. In other words, the model doesn’t afford any insight into the relative advantage of setting up a store in a given a area versus another, because any increased revenue from a chosen area is immediately offset by a corresponding increase in expenses that affects every store within a revenue range uniformly.\n\n\nA Potential Solution\nOne way to ameliorate this problem is to simply give more control to the user of the application in choosing their own expense percentages. That way, the user can tinker with the tool in order to determine (in a broad way) how much resources they must have and how they must allocate those resources in order to be profitable in a certain location. We propose that this can be done through R Shiny. R Shiny allows for numeric inputs into functions by means of a user-controlled slider. Through this method, there is no need to discard the default percentages that we were previously working with; rather, instead of being hard-coded into the function, they can be placed as labels along the slider or set as default values that the user can adjust manually if they so choose.\n\n\n\nSlider input example (Shiny)\n\n\nThis way, the user can know the industry averages for different variables while also comparing their own plans with those averages.\n\n\nThe Rounding Problem\nAnother issue I faced was one involving the rounding of percentages of my functions. I had rounded the original percentages up or down depending on whether they were considered a cost or an expense in the balance sheet, and this affected my output significantly when I went to compare my R output to the example provided by Duane (our client) in his excel sheet. Thankfully, when I reverted the percentages to their original state (4 decimal places), my outputs then matched the one’s displayed in the excel sheet. The big takeaway from this is that most of the time, the final output is what should be rounded in a calculation and not the intermediaries. I mistakenly thought that rounding the percentages used in the calculation in certain directions could provide a more “conservative” or “risky” weight to the final prediction. However, since we were dealing with small percentages of very large numbers, the degree of rounding that was there greatly impacted overall accuracy and rendered the predictions illogical. Thankfully, the functions work as they are supposed to now (even thought they may undergo a significant rewrite later).\n\n\nGeocoding/Reverse Geocoding\nAlongside working on the expenses functions, I also looked into the problem of obtaining the names of locations within the radius of a point for the purpose of obtaining relevant population information necessary for estimating market size. Two processes are important in helping to accomplish this task: geocoding and reverse geocoding. Geocoding simply means being able to take an address or name of a location and return a set of coordinates fo that location. Reverse geocoding is its opposite: it takes a set of coordinates as input an returns an address in response.\nOne package that I found to be useful while working on this problem was revgeo. Revgeo is an R package for reverse geocoding that returns the city, state, country and zip code of a set of coordinates provided by the user.\n\nrevgeo_address &lt;- function(longitude, latitude) {\n  \n  API_KEY &lt;- Sys.getenv(\"GOOGLE_API_KEY\")\n  \n  address &lt;- revgeo::revgeo(longitude = longitude, latitude = latitude, \n                            provider = 'google', output = \"frame\",\n                            API = API_KEY)\n  \n  address\n}\n\naddress &lt;- revgeo_address(-92,41)\n\n\naddress\n\n  housenumber            street      city        county state   zip\n1         807 South 32nd Street Fairfield United States  Iowa 52556\n        country\n1 United States\n\n\nThis package proved to be useful for making a basic function that gets the list of nearby counties within a radius of a set of coordinates. However, the biggest flaw is that the “county” column isn’t accurate; it lists the name of the country instead. For our purposes, this was a significant roadblock, as having the county of a point makes retrieving data from TidyCensus a lot easier.\nMore on the process of geocoding will be found below."

    "text": "Grocery Survey: First Impressions\nWe have also been looking over the results of a survey conducted by Iowa State Extension and Outreach (sponsored by AgMRC) that asked owners and senior managers of independently-owned rural grocery stores throughout Iowa a series of questions about their store’s performance, selection and design, as well as the top challenges they face in keeping their store profitable. The survey divided Iowa into 3 regions and examined the survey results accordingly:\n\n\n\nThree regions analyzed by the survey.\n\n\nOne issue with the survey was the low response rate: only 95 out of 671 independent grocers responded (14.2%). However, the findings might still be useful to look at for our purposes.\nHere are some charts I found interesting:\n\n\n\nTop challenges faced by small grocers in Iowa\n\n\n\n\n\nDifficulties in purchasing and selling local products\n\n\nThere is much more potentially useful information, such as information about the most frequently found unique assets of stores and the specific types of local products most frequently bought according to region, shown here:\n\n\n\nType of local foods purchased by region\n\n\nOverall, this survey may help us provide useful information to the users of our tool and can help grant us perspective on how well the functionality of our tools maps onto the ground truth of what is really going on with rural grocery stores in Iowa. I found it to be a very interesting and useful resource."
