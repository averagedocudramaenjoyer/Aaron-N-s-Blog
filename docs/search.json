One of the biggest takeaways for me was being introduced to the “stringr” package and learning how to detect key words in strings. Along with that, I feel I have a clearer understanding of the “ifelse()” function and how it works. I also remembered how to add error bars to plots and how to make maps given the presence of the appropriate data. I’m looking forward to exploring these data sets even more and hope they will prove to be useful for our project."

During the first part of the week, our group searched TidyCensus, the USDA and various other internet sources for data that could potentially be useful for whichever type of tool that we and our client decide on.\nIt could be said that we have started moving into the second phase of our project this week: data collection.\n\nOn Thursday, we met with our client and some of his associates at the the research park to discuss the direction of the project. We had them answer various questions on Mentimeter and showed them the list of datasets under consideration. They also gave us numerous suggestions about sources they were familiar with and told us that they would help grant us access to those of which were not immediately available to us.\n\n\nHere are some of the Mentimeter results from our meeting:\n\n\n\nAs we are wrapping up this week, we have now shifted our focus to compiling our selected data to our repository and filtering through sources that may not be as useful as others. We are continuing to think of ways to optimize this process, as well as remaining open to other sources of data or information that we have yet to discover.

However, for a reason I don’t entirely understand, I haven’t gotten it to work the way I should. It’s possible that this has to do with the limitations of the API call and its speed within the loop.\n\nyearlist &lt;- c(2009, 2012, 2016, 2021)\ngeo_list &lt;- c(\"county\", \"tract\")\nIncome_table_list &lt;- c(\"B19013\", \"B19113\", \"B19202\", \"B19051\", \"B19055\")\nacs_table &lt;- NULL\n\n\nfor(table in Income_table_list)\n\n  for(year in yearlist)\n  \n    for(geography in geo_list)\n    \n      acs_table &lt;- tidycensus::get_acs(geography = geography,\n                                       table = table,\n                                       state = \"IA\",\n                                       year = year,\n                                       survey = \"acs5\")\n      \n      write_csv(acs_table, file = sprintf(\"%s_%s_%s\", table, year, geography))\n\nHowever, even if this didn’t completely work, I learned a lot of useful information, such as the “sprintf” function that provides placeholders for strings that are named from iterating variables in loop, as well as how to call only necessary elements of a library into a function to prevent using too much memory/slowing run time."

    "text": "Grocery Project:\nThis week was centered on converting the sheets that our client gave us to useful functions for our project package. My functions were R translations of our clients sheet for estimating expenses of potential rural grocery stores.\nSo far, there are 8 functions that are derived from the expense estimation sheet, yet it is still a work in progress. Here are the ones we have so far:\nCost_of_Goods_Sold()\nGross_Margin()\nOfficer_Compensation()\nEmployee_Wages()\nOther_Operating_Expense()\nOperating_Income_Loss()\nAnnual_Rent()\nInterest_Expense()\nMany of these functions give different outputs based on the range that the input for total estimated revenue falls into. Here, the revenue ranges are listed in a table with the corresponding percentages for each variable (in decimal form):\n\nTherefore, some of our functions required a way to account for these differences. As it stands, this is dealt with through nested ifelse statements.\n\nEmployee_Wages &lt;- function(Total_Estimated_Revenue) {\n\n  ifelse(Total_Estimated_Revenue &lt; 500000, stop(\"error: no data for this revenue range\"),\n         percentage &lt;- ifelse(Total_Estimated_Revenue &lt; 999999.99, .0789,\n                              ifelse(Total_Estimated_Revenue &lt; 2499999.99, .0934,\n                                     ifelse(Total_Estimated_Revenue &lt; 4999999.99, .0751,\n                                            ifelse(Total_Estimated_Revenue &lt; 24999999.99, .0975, .1083)))))\n\n\n\n  Total_Estimated_Revenue * percentage\n}\n\nIt’s likely that more work needs to be done for error handling in functions like these.\nHere’s a function that depends on some other functions in the package:\n\nOperating_Income_Loss &lt;- function(Total_Estimated_Revenue) {\n  Goods_cost &lt;- Cost_of_Goods_Sold(Total_Estimated_Revenue)\n  Officer_comp &lt;- Officer_Compensation(Total_Estimated_Revenue)\n  Employee_Wages &lt;- Employee_Wages(Total_Estimated_Revenue)\n  Other_Expense &lt;- Other_Operating_Expense(Total_Estimated_Revenue)\n\n  Total_Estimated_Revenue - sum(Goods_cost, Officer_comp, Employee_Wages,\n                                Other_Expense)\n}\n\nMost of the functions only take one argument: Total Estimated Revenue. This will be calculated from the functions made from our revenue estimation sheet (Srika). Other functions, such as Annual_Rent() or Interest_Expense(), have inputs that are dependent upon a user’s individual scenario, such as the size of a loan or the rate of monthly rent for the building.\nThere are still questions left to be answered, such as how to precisely estimate the cost of depreciation and how to determine the correct use life of certain assets. However, our team all made significant progress this week.\n\n\nCoffee Talk\nI also learned a lot about text mining in R this week. I decided to compare the reviews from two gaming journalistic outlets for the past 5 Legend of Zelda games using certain text mining techniques. Some of the interesting libraries I learned about include:\n\ntm\ntidytext\nRWeka\nqdap\nplotrix\nrvest\nwordcloud\nsyuzhet\n\nHere are some plots from the project:\n\n\n\nWordcloud of the whole Zelda series\n\n\n\n\n\nPyramid Plot of IGN vs. Gamespot\n\n\n\n\n\nSentiments for Tears of the Kingdom\n\n\nMany of the techniques used for the project was from the Datacamp course “Text Mining with Bag of Words in R” and “Sentiment Analysis in R”.\nOverall, today has been a pretty good week."
